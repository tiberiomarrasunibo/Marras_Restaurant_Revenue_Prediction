# Marras_Restaurant_Revenue_Prediction
Machine Learning project for Master in AI

The project is a machine learning regression task ispired on the Kaggle competition "Restaurant Revenue Prediction" available on the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/restaurant-revenue-prediction/overview

The aim of the project is to create a reliable mathematical model able to predict the revenues of 100.000 restaurant.
The training is based on a dataset of 137 restaurants with 42 features and the target variable.
The result score of several regressors is computed and compared. The model with the best Negative Root Mean Squared Error is used to make the predictions.
A neural network is included in the regressors, with a slightly different preprocessing of the dataset.

In the main directory is present the Python notebook and the powerpoint presentation.
The notebook must be in the same directory of "restaurant-revenue-prediction" in order to retrieve the datasets and to output the predictions.
The "Report" directory contains the pdf of the report and the source tex file.
In the "img" directory there are the images used by the tex file.
To compile the tex file the "img" directory must be in the same directory of the tex file.
